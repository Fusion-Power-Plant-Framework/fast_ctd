The files in this directory were taken from the [occ_faceter](https://github.com/makeclean/occ_faceter) repository.

The original source code has been adapted to use a new logging library, with parts of it removed or changed depending on the needs of this project. The main goal of these changes to include only the necessary code and upgrade it use later versions of OpenCASCADE, MOAB and Python.
